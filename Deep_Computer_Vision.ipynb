For an image of color depth 1 we would likely have a greyscale image with one value defining each pixel, again in the range of 0-255.\n",

        "The fundemental difference between a dense layer and a convolutional layer is that dense layers detect patterns globally while convolutional layers detect patterns locally. When we have a densely connected layer each node in that layer sees all the data from the previous layer. This means that this layer is looking at all the information and is only capable of analyzing the data in a global capacity. Our convolutional layer however will not be densly connected, this means it can detect local patterns using part of the input data to that layer.\n",

        "A filter is a m x n pattern of pixels that we are looking for in an image. The number of filters in a convolutional layer reprsents how many patterns each layer is looking for and what the depth of our response map will be. If we are looking for 32 different patterns/filters than our output feature map (aka the response map) will have a depth of 32. Each one of the 32 layers of depth will be a matrix of some size containing values indicating if the filter was present at that location or not.\n",

        "This isn't really the best term to describe this, but each convolutional layer is going to examine n x m blocks of pixels in each image. Typically, we'll consider 3x3 or 5x5 blocks. In the example above we use a 3x3 \"sample size\". This size will be the same as the size of our filter. \n",

        "The idea behind a pooling layer is to downsample our feature maps and reduce their dimensions. They work in a similar way to convolutional layers where they extract windows from the feature map and return a response map of the max, min or average values of each channel. Pooling is usually done using windows of size 2x2 and a stride of 2. This will reduce the size of the feature map by a factor of two and return a response map that is 2x smaller."
